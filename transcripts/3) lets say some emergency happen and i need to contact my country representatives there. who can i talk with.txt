## **⚠️ Important Note**

As I mentioned earlier, **the Israeli Embassy in Dublin was closed as of December 15, 2024** due to a decision by the Israeli Foreign Minister. This means:

- **Limited or no consular services** may be available
- You should **call ahead** before visiting to confirm current operations
- For emergencies, you may need to contact the Israeli Foreign Ministry directly or seek assistance through other channels

**Recommendation**: Before your trip, contact the embassy via phone or email to:
1. Confirm they are operational
2. Register your travel (optional but recommended)
3. Ask about emergency procedures if the embassy is closed

**Alternative**: If the Dublin embassy is unavailable, you can contact the Israeli Foreign Ministry's emergency hotline or the nearest operational Israeli diplomatic mission.
