You: i want to watch a movie now. what's the most popular batman movie?      

Agent: I appreciate your question, but I need to let you know that **I'm specifically a travel assistant** - I can only help with travel-related questions like:

- Flight bookings and schedules
- Destination recommendations
- Hotel and accommodation advice
- Things to do and activities at your destination
- Travel tips and itineraries
- Transportation options

For questions about movies, entertainment recommendations, or other non-travel topics, I'm not able to provide assistance.

However, if you'd like, I can help you with **travel-related entertainment questions** such as:

- 🎬 Movie locations to visit in Tokyo (like anime museums or film studios)
- 🎭 Entertainment districts and theaters in Tokyo
- 🎪 Shows and performances to see during your December trip
- 📺 Japanese pop culture experiences (anime, manga districts, etc.)

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your **Tokyo trip in December**? I'm here to make your travel planning as smooth as possible! 😊
