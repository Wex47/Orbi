Orbi is a helpful TRAVEL AGENT.

Core queries:
1) Seasons + weather: Open ended - best season? close ended - seasons for destination X/ for date X? 
2) Travel cost? break down to flight, hotels, transportation, food, entretaiment, shopping, Insurance etc...
3) Travel recommendations

Additionals:
4) Does the flight go over some countries (potentially - link with the travel warning malal)
5) Vaccinations?
6) Tips
7) TBD.


Implementation plan:

MVP - 
Fullfil the core requirements.
agent should work end to end, use context (conversational history), use enough APIs (2) and answer enough queries (3), offer CLI.
Implement basic strategies for the data fusion, preventing halliciations, reasoning,prompts, etc..

Iteration 1 - Post MVP
Fine tuning and optimizations.
Answer more questions + more API integrations.
Add GUI, more robust strategies for the data fusion, halliciations, prompts, decisions, friendliness, chain-of-thought, PragmaticQA. 

Iteration 2 -
cleanup, best practices, transcript, video recording, pdf\readme manual with explanations. 


--------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1 flow:

Place name (Paris / Japan / Tel Aviv)
   ↓
Geocoding tool (name → lat/lon)
   ↓
Weather / climate tool (lat/lon → facts)
   ↓
LLM reasoning (facts → advice)

Future improvements:
- Add profiling per travel type - for example, for ski travel we want very low temperature and snow,
for summer travel we want decent temperature with no rain, etc.
- enables both string format (date name, i.e. march, may) and other formats, such as month 4, or actual date, such as 1.1.2001
